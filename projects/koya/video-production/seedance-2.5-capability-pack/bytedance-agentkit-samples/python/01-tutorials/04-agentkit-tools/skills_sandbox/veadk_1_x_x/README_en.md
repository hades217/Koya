# Skills Sandbox - Build a Skills-Capable Agent with VeADK and AgentKit

Build a skills-capable Agent based on Volcengine VeADK and AgentKit.

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to create a skills-capable Agent in AgentKit.

## Key Features

- Skill loading methods: load local skills, load from the AgentKit platform Skills Center, and load from TOS.
- Skill execution methods: execute skills in the runtime, Skill Sandbox, or AIO (All in One) Sandbox.
- Upload skill task results to TOS.
- Support local debugging and cloud deployment.

### Core Components

| Component | Description |
| - | - |
| **Agent Service** | [agent.py](https://github.com/bytedance/agentkit-samples/blob/main/python/01-tutorials/04-agentkit-tools/skills_sandbox/veadk-1.x.x/agent.py) - Main application that defines the Agent and memory component |
| **Test Client** | [client.py](https://github.com/bytedance/agentkit-samples/blob/main/python/01-tutorials/04-agentkit-tools/skills_sandbox/veadk-1.x.x/client.py) - SSE streaming invocation client |
| **Project Configuration** | [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/bytedance/agentkit-samples/blob/main/python/01-tutorials/04-agentkit-tools/skills_sandbox/veadk-1.x.x/pyproject.toml) - Dependency management with uv |
| **AgentKit Configuration** | agentkit.yaml - Cloud deployment configuration file |
| **Short-Term Memory** | Stores session context using a local backend |

## Directory Structure

```bash
skills_sandbox/veadk-1.x.x/
├── agent.py           # Agent runs a skills task
├── client.py          # Test client (SSE streaming invocation)
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependency list (must be specified during AgentKit deployment)
├── pyproject.toml     # Project configuration (uv dependency management)
├── agentkit.yaml      # AgentKit deployment configuration (automatically generated after running agentkit config)
├── Dockerfile         # Docker image build file (automatically generated after running agentkit config)

```

## Run Locally

### Prerequisites

**1. Enable the Volcengine Ark model service:**

- Visit the [Volcengine Ark console](https://exp.volcengine.com/ark?mode=chat).
- Enable the model service.

**2. Obtain Volcengine access credentials:**

- Refer to the [user guide](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/6291/65568?lang=en) to obtain an AK/SK.

### Install Dependencies

#### 1. Install the uv package manager

```bash
# macOS / Linux (official installation script)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or use Homebrew (macOS)
brew install uv
```

#### 2. Initialize project dependencies

```bash
# Enter the project directory
cd python/01-tutorials/04-agentkit-tools/skills_sandbox/veadk-1.x.x
```

You can install this project's dependencies with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install them with `uv`:

```bash
# If you do not have a `uv` virtual environment, create one first
uv venv --python 3.12

# Manage dependencies with `pyproject.toml`
uv sync --index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

# Or manage dependencies with `requirements.txt`
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Prepare the Environment

```bash
# Configure the AgentKit tool ID (required for the AIO Sandbox)
export AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID=<Your_Tool_ID>

# Configure the AgentKit Skill Space ID (required; use the ID beginning with ss-)
export SKILL_SPACE_ID=<Your_Skill_Space_ID>

# Volcengine access credentials (required)
export VOLCENGINE_ACCESS_KEY=<Your Access Key>
export VOLCENGINE_SECRET_KEY=<Your Secret Key>
```

`agent.py` reads the remote Skill Space from `SKILL_SPACE_ID`. Set it before starting the local service; otherwise, the remote Skill Registry cannot be initialized.

### Debugging

```bash
# Enter the project directory
cd python/01-tutorials/04-agentkit-tools/skills_sandbox/veadk-1.x.x

# Start the VeADK web UI
veadk web --port 8080

# Open in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

The web UI provides a graphical conversation testing environment and supports real-time inspection of message streams and debugging information.

You can also use the command line to test and debug `agent.py`.

```bash
cd python/01-tutorials/04-agentkit-tools/skills_sandbox/veadk-1.x.x

# Start the Agent service
uv run agent.py
# The service listens on http://0.0.0.0:8000

# Open a new terminal and run the test client
# Edit client.py first and change base_url on line 13 to http://0.0.0.0:8000
uv run client.py
```

# Configure deployment parameters
# Optional: if you do not add --runtime_envs AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID={{your_tool_id}} in agentkit config,
# you can go to AgentKit Console -> Agent Runtime -> Key Components, select Sandbox Tool, and publish it.
agentkit config \
--agent_name agent_skills \
--entry_point 'agent.py' \
--runtime_envs AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID={{your_tool_id}} \
--runtime_envs SKILL_SPACE_ID={{your_skill_space_id}} \
--launch_type cloud

# Start the cloud service
agentkit launch

# Test the deployed Agent
agentkit invoke 'Please run the following workflow: 1. Write a PDF-processing skill that supports loading PDFs, editing PDFs, and extracting text from PDFs; 2. Register the completed skill to the skill space.'

# Or use client.py to connect to the cloud service
# Edit client.py first and change base_url and api_key on lines 13 and 14 to the runtime_endpoint and runtime_apikey fields generated in agentkit.yaml
uv run client.py
```

### Invoke a Sandbox directly over A2A

To create or reuse a Sandbox Session and invoke its A2A endpoint directly, see
the [A2A invocation guide](advanced/a2a/README_en.md).

## Built-in Skills

- Remember to replace `{YOUR_TOS_BUCKET_NAME}`. This is the TOS bucket that AgentKit creates for users by default, in the format `agentkit-platform-{your_account_id}`. If this TOS bucket does not exist, you need to create it yourself.

| Skill | Description | Example Prompt |
| ------ | --- | --------- |
| tos-file-access | Upload files or directories to Volcengine TOS and download files from URLs. Use this skill in the following cases: (1) upload files or directories generated by the Agent, such as videos, images, reports, or output folders, to TOS for sharing; (2) download files from URLs before the Agent processes them. | Please run the following workflow: 1. Use `tos-file-access` to download a `topk_benchmark.cpp` code file from `https://agentkit-skills.tos-cn-beijing.volces.com/upload/topk_benchmark.cpp`. 2. Use `code-optimization` to improve this code by implementing the `my_topk_inplace` function. The performance must be excellent and better than the standard-library implementation in the code. 3. Use `tos-file-access` to upload the final output directory, including the final code and report, to the bucket `{YOUR_TOS_BUCKET_NAME}`. |
| code-optimization | Optimize code performance through iterative improvement, up to 2 rounds. Benchmark execution time and memory usage, compare them with the baseline implementation, and generate a detailed optimization report. Supports C++, Python, Java, Rust, and other languages. | See the prompt in the previous `tos-file-access` row. |
| veadk-python | Implement a runnable Agent based on the VeADK framework. | Please run the following workflow: 1. Use the `veadk-python` skill to write a VeADK Agent that can reply when asked "hello". 2. Write the completed code to a new local code file, then use the `tos-file-access` skill to upload this code file to the bucket `{YOUR_TOS_BUCKET_NAME}`, and finally send me the uploaded code file link. |
